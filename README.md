## Recommendation
- Recommendation systems can be categorized into three types:
1. Content-Based: This approach recommends movies based on the content you have previously watched. For instance, if you watch a comedy or action movie, it will suggest other movies in the same genre.
2. Collaborative Filtering: Used by platforms like Netflix, this method leverages the preferences of similar users to make recommendations. For example, if you and Kevin both watched "BMB," the algorithm recognizes your similar tastes. Therefore, if you watch "ZNMD," it will likely recommend the same movie to Kevin.
3. Hybrid: This technique combines both content-based and collaborative filtering methods. YouTube, for example, uses this approach by recommending videos based on both the context of the videos you watch and the viewing habits of others with similar interests.

### Flow of doing project
- It's very important to get your project flow right. Here's a structured approach:
1. Data: First, we collect the data.
2. Preprocessing: In this step, we perform data cleaning and other necessary preprocessing tasks.
3. Model: Next, we train the model. Once we are satisfied with its performance, we proceed to the next step.
4. Save: We save the trained model.
5. Testing: We conduct dry run testing to ensure everything works as expected.
